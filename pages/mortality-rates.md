## The Rising Mortality Rates of Alzheimer's and Dementia-Related Diseases in Greece

These two charts show the mortality rates and percentage change in mortality rates in Greece between 2000 and 2020, measured per 100,000 people. They also demonstrate how changing the statistical unit - examining relative changes versus raw rates - can reveal additional patterns in datasets. More specifically:

Absolute Mortality Rates: Malignant neoplasms (cancers) remain the leading cause of death in Greece, with a gradual increase in mortality over time. They are followed by cerebrovascular diseases (such as strokes), which are declining, and ischaemic heart diseases, which are relatively stable, likely due to improvements in treatments, prevention programs, and better management of risk factors.

Respiratory infections remained relatively stable until experiencing an increase in 2020, likely reflecting the impact of COVID-19.

As this chart shows, deaths from dementia remain relatively low, at levels close to those of diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which affect the lungs.

Percentage Change in Mortality Rates Since 2000: However, the second chart - illustrating how mortality rates have evolved relative to their levels in 2000 -shows that deaths due to Alzheimerâ€™s and other dementias have increased dramatically, particularly after 2015. Rising trends are also evident in diabetes and lung diseases, while the remaining causes of death are either stable or declining.

These trends could suggest that while advancements in cardiovascular healthcare have reduced deaths from heart disease and stroke, no such progress has been made in reducing deaths from dementia-related conditions. This points out to the need for enhanced healthcare policies, better support systems, and increased research into neurodegenerative diseases.
