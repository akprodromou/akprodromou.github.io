# Customer Churn Prediction

This project explores customer churn using a telecom dataset. It applies machine learning models to identify churn risk and understand key drivers.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest models
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, recall, ROC-AUC
- SHAP values to explain model predictions
